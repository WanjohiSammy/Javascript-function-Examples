A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

For Example:
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
    return p1 * p2;  // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}

A function is defined by a keyword "function",followed by a name, followed by (). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
e.g.
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    code to be executed
}

Another to consider here is JavaScript RegExp.
A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters.

Regular expressions are used to perform pattern-matching and "search-and-replace" functions on text.
